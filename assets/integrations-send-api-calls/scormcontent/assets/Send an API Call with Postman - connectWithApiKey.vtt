00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.660
From the WebServices API Documentation Overview
page, select ConnectionService to expand the

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:08.950
list of methods.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.120
Then, select the connectWithApiKey method.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.600
Each method includes a brief description,
the method’s result, and the Return Type,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.730
such as an integer, Boolean, string, and so
on.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.660
This information helps you anticipate the
output of your API call.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.130
Because we’re expecting a connectionID, which
includes numbers and letters, the Return Type

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.280
will be a string, as opposed to, say, an integer,
which would only include whole numbers.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.840
The method also includes the required Parameters—which
are the placeholders or variables that you

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.770
must define—the Data Type for each parameter,
whether each parameter is Required or optional

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.309
in your call, and a Hint, which is a description
of the parameter.

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.670
For example, you may be confused about what
the logoutCurrentWebConnection parameter does.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.289
The hint helps you understand that if this
value is true, your API call will, “disconnect

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:05.990
the user’s current web session”, which
is akin to logging out.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.130
Next, let’s look at the Example Call.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.400
This is the actual text you’ll copy and
use for your API call.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.380
Notice how the example call is formatted to
include curly brackets around the array of

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.330
text and how quotation marks are wrapped around
each variable.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.259
This format is called JSON—JavaScript Object
Notation—and it makes the data you’ll

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.960
pass in your API call understandable to humans
and computers.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.659
Notice that the Example Result is also formatted
using JSON.

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.829
To use this method, copy the Example Call.

00:01:42.829 --> 00:02:02.630
Open Postman, and select Send an API request.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.890
Since we are sending our API key to our MasterControl
site—instead of, say, asking for information

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.290
on the site—we’ll select POST as the method.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.410
Copy the first part of your MasterControl
site—for example, https://[site].mastercontrol.com/[site]—and

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.390
concatenate with the following string: /ws/JSONBridge.cfm.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.849
Paste the entire URL in the Enter URL or paste
text box.

00:02:23.063 --> 00:02:27.849
Lastly, select the Send button to send the
API call.

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.239
If we did everything right, we’ll see a
result with our connection ID.

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.680
If not, we’ll begin the beloved process
of troubleshooting.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.520
Looks like we have success!

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.020
This is our connectionID, and we'll use it
in the next video.
