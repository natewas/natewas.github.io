00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.400
Let’s look at a demonstration of the RESTful API.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.320
First, navigate to the RESTful API documentation.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.640
We’ll use the "Get latest revision" endpoint. 
Here, you can see the syntax, the description,

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:22.200
the path parameters, and a URL that you can 
copy and paste in Postman for your API call.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.000
We’ll open a new call in Postman. Select 
the Authorization tab. Then, select the Type

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.680
dropdown and choose Bearer Token. Simply enter 
your API key in the Token field. Once again,

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.040
we’re using a variable for our API key. 
One nice thing about the RESTful API is

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.800
you don’t need to include an API key or 
connectionID in your API call syntax. When

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.040
you add your API key as a Bearer Token, 
the API call knows where to look for it.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:58.480
Next, we’ll paste the endpoint URL we copied from 
the API documentation. Edit any field with a curly

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:08.480
bracket surrounding it . We’ll enter the same 
InfoCard number from the last video: TRN-SOP-0015.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.440
Lastly, select Send.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.360
Here is the result.
