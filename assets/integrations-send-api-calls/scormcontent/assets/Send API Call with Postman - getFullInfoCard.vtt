00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.640
Let’s look at one more example. Let’s assume 
I want to send an API call that returns the

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:15.440
details of a specific InfoCard. The 
InfoCard number is TRN-SOP-0015. In

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.200
the Web Services API documentation, 
select the getFullInfoCard method.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.400
The getFullInfoCard method will “Retrieve 
an InfoCard with a few additional fields.”

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.000
Here, we’ll utilize the connectionID we 
created in the last video. We’ll also

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.080
enter the InfoCard Number and Revision. 
Notice these are required parameters.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:45.240
Copy the example call, create a new API call 
in Postman, and enter the required arguments:

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:59.240
the connectionID, InfoCard Number, and Revision.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:08.480
We’ll use the GET method, and ensure we’re sending 
the call to the correct site. Then, select Send.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.560
Here is the InfoCard information.
