00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.960
Here, we'll demonstrate how to use a filter to 
see only results with the training status Overdue.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.860
To filter, select Search Filters 
and enter the keyword Training.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.780
Then, find the Training Status filter, and 
select the toggle to turn the filter on.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.180
Note the teal box that says, Include all, which 
means the filter isn’t filtering anything yet.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.680
Edit the filter by hovering over the 
Training Status box to reveal and

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.060
select the pencil or Edit Filter icon. 
This will open the Edit Filter window.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.520
The default selection will be Include all (no 
filter applied). Remember, for this example,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.040
you want the filter to only show results with the 
Training Status Overdue. There are multiple ways

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.720
to manipulate the filter to do what you want.
The easiest method would be to select the

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.940
option next to Find, and use the search to find 
the field or fields you need. The Select All

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.440
option will select all the results within your 
search. But for a short list like this, you can

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.480
simply select the checkbox next to Overdue.
Another method would be to select the option

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.480
next to the Is not and Select from list dropdowns. 
Then, select the Is not dropdown, and select Is.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.580
Finally, select the Select from list dropdown, 
and select the checkbox next to Overdue.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.160
Lastly, select the Apply button.
The widgets now only show results based

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.480
on the training status Overdue filter, making 
it incredibly simple to interpret the data.
