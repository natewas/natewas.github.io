            <h1>Digital Credential Programs</h1>
            <p class="tldr">TL;DR: Wrote 700+ exam questions (without putting people to sleep). Automated everything from learner enrollment to badge delivery, making each step of the process highly efficient. Collaborated with stakeholders to ensure the questions weren’t too easy (or alienating), then piloted, tweaked, and scaled it all with a +88 NPS. Basically, I turned chaos into a certification machine that everyone loved.</p>

                As the principal designer of the MasterControl Certified Admin and Certified 
                Integrations Developer digital credential program, I created and implemented 
                a scalable, automated initiatives to assess and validate the expertise of 
                MasterControl administrators and developers. I wrote over 700 examination 
                questions and built automated processes for user enrollment, grading, 
                recertification, and credential issuance. I also worked with subject-matter 
                experts to design stable "sandbox" test environments. These efforts drove a 
                96% learner satisfaction rate and an impressive +88 Net Promoter Score (NPS).
            </p>
            <p>
                Using Python, I developed a dashboard that automated key workflows, including 
                user account creation for sandbox environments, grading and weighting exam 
                sections to generate overall scores, and using Credly’s API to issue digital 
                badges. I also developed a dynamic email messaging system that provided 
                examinees with personalized feedback and customized communication. These 
                streamlined processes enabled the program to scale efficiently, resulting in 
                a 75% decrease in total administration costs and the issuance of more than 600 badges.
            </p>
            <p>
                Crafting exam questions presented a unique challenge. I worked to ensure that 
                questions targeted core competencies without excluding users with varied workflows 
                or expertise. To address this, I collaborated with stakeholders across the company 
                and conducted pilot testing with customers to refine the questions and improve the 
                user experience. By automating the administration process, I made scaling the program 
                not only feasible but seamless.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, what's a robust program without insight into how it performs? Nothing. So, I created
                a Domo dashboard that pulls data from multiple sources--Qualtrics, Credly, and Skilljar--
                to provide a leaders in the company with data on the health of the program. They can go 
                as deep into the data as they want.
            </p>

                This project highlights my ability to design and execute complex learning initiatives 
                that align with organizational goals, enhance user satisfaction, and deliver measurable 
                outcomes. It demonstrates my expertise in instructional design, process automation, and 
                cross-functional collaboration.
