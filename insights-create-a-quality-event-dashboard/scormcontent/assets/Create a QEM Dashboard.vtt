00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.920
In this video, we’ll demonstrate how 
to create a new Advanced QEM dashboard.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:13.120
In Insights, let's create a new folder. 
We’ll also enter a name for the folder.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.800
Next, we’ll create a new dashboard, 
select the Advanced QEM data source,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.320
and enter a title for the 
dashboard. Then, select Create.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.520
Before creating a widget, we should 
consider the questions we want to

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.960
address in our dashboard. Let’s say we 
want to answer the following questions:

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.320
- What tags are included in our forms?

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.760
- What workflow is each tag on?

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.800
- What is the name of each event?

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.640
- How did users respond to each form question?

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.600
Now that we’ve identified our 
questions, let’s add a widget.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.840
Let’s select a table as our chart.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.920
Now, the first question we want to answer 
is, “What tags are included in our forms?”

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.920
So let’s add a column, and search for and 
select the Analytics Tag Name attribute.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:07.200
Great! Now, the second question we want to 
answer is, “What workflow is each tag on?”

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.600
Let’s add another column, and search for 
and select the Workflow Name attribute.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.280
The third question we want to answer 
is, “What is the name of each event?”

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.160
Let’s add another column, and search 
for and select the Event Name attribute.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.560
The fourth question we want to answer 
is, “How did users respond to each form question?”

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:37.000
Let’s add another column, and search for and 
select the Event Element Value attribute.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:48.240
The last thing we’ll do is create a widget filter 
to exclude tag names with the value Personal.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.200
And, of course, we’ll enter a 
widget name, and select Apply.
